MoonLight Macro is able to utilize a powerful 3d geometric API viewer that guides the player's movement. With a prebuilt configuration ready to use. 
This software is made in C#, expect some minor/massive bugs due to imcomplete coding, and some TypeCast/Runtime Return errors. Thank you for using MoonLight Macro!

Using this software requires  ****Turning off AntiVirus****, as due to the DLLs emplaced within the software, controls your keyboard, mouse, and screen. (There is a built in safety key to disable the macro whenever you wish to.) Due to these DLLs emplaced, we have to emplace these measurements to make sure you have the fullest of your delightful experience.

IQRL/DRIVER ISSUES

If you have experiencing/being blocked from using the software by a error emplaced correlative to driver issues relating to the screen or etc. Please try the following:

Turning off your antivirus. (Turning off your antivirus makes the software be able to payload the DLLs to the processes accordingly.)
Clearing out %temp% (Temp may be bloating the software and due to storage error, no matter how much free storage you have, it could hinder the software.)
Within the folder: "INDEPENDENCIES", there should be exactly 16 DLLs. (If even one DLL is missing, the software will display an driver error due to a typecasting error.)
