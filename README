# THIS PROGRAM/SOFTWARE IS STILL IN BETA, EXPECT BUGS
MoonLight Macro is able to utilize a powerful 3d geometric API viewer that guies the player's movement. With a prebuilt configuration ready to use. 
This software is made in C#, expect some minor/massive bugs due to imcomplete coding, and some TypeCast/Runtime Return errors. Thank you for using MoonLight Macro!
